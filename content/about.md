## About Me

I've never been good at talking about myself, but here goes:  
I've always had a passion for tinkering with computers. When I was 13 years old,
I set up a Minecraft server on an old laptop that my family had. That experience
opened up the field of self-hosting for me, eventually leading to my current
situation where I am studying to be an IT professional, and operating multiple
servers at my home and in the cloud. Outside of computers, I enjoy hiking,
playing with my dog, and listening to sad music.

## About the Site

The fonts used on this site are as follows:

- Noto Serif for most text
- Poppins for headings
- JetBrains Mono for code snippets

The colorscheme comes from the Nord palette by Arctic Ice Studio.  
 The server is hosted on Vultr.  
 The server is managed with a
[custom Ansible playbook](https://github.com/rebeccafez/iac).
